# GettisLang

## My Language

It’s not traditional.  
It’s not optimal.  
It’s not simple.  

But it’s **consistent**.  
It’s **expressive**.  
It’s **mine**.  

No keywords.  
No types.  
No hidden scopes.  

Just calls.  
Just objects.  
Just paths.  

> **Programming can be poetic.**  
> **Art doesn’t follow rules.**

This language isn’t here to win benchmarks.  
It’s here to explore.  
To play.  
To **create**.

## What is GettisLang?

GettisLang is a programming language designed to explore and experiment with the boundaries of how we think about code. It doesn't follow traditional rules — instead, it encourages creativity, exploration, and expression. GettisLang is built to be **yours**, to represent your own ideas, not the ideals set by others.
